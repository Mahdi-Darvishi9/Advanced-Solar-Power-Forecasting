# ⚡ Advanced Solar Power Forecasting

**Accurately forecasting solar energy generation—without using irradiance data.**

## 🌞 Value Proposition

Solar energy is vital for a sustainable future. But its unpredictable nature—due to time, location, and weather—makes forecasting a challenge. Traditional models rely on costly irradiance data, requiring satellite feeds or on-site sensors.

This project introduces one of only two models in the world that completely eliminates that dependence. Instead, it leverages easily accessible geographic, meteorological, and temporal data to deliver highly accurate solar power predictions—at a fraction of the cost. This shift enables fast, scalable, and affordable deployment of solar forecasting tools worldwide.

## 🧠 Methodology Summary

This hybrid ensemble model is built using **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and a **Linear Regression meta-model**. It includes advanced feature engineering, including:

- **Temporal Feature Engineering:** Extracted time-based features (month, day, hour) and converted them into **cyclic features** using sine and cosine to preserve daily and seasonal continuity.
- **Environmental Feature Smoothing:** Used rolling averages and exponentially weighted moving averages for temperature and wind speed to reduce noise.
- **Solar Geometry Calculations:** Computed **solar elevation** and **azimuth angles** from latitude and solar position equations to capture sunlight angles more precisely.
- **Feature Selection with RFE:** Recursive Feature Elimination optimized the feature set (103–109 features) for each base model, significantly boosting performance.
- **Model Stacking:** XGBoost and LightGBM predictions were combined using a **Linear Regression meta-model**, allowing for interpretability, speed, and enhanced accuracy.
